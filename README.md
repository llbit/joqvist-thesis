# Contributions to Declarative Implementation of Static Program Analysis

This repository contains the TeX sources for my thesis.
The sources should be compiled with XeLaTeX and Biber.

I have made a few minor revisions since the published version of the thesis.
The version number in the frontmatter reflects the current version of the
thesis.  The bugs listed in the errata have been corrected in this revised
version.

Tools and packages used:

* LaTeX.
* Inkscape and PGF/TikZ for graphics.
* The [Forest package](https://ctan.org/pkg/forest?lang=en) by Saso Zivanovic for drawing trees.
* Chris Monson's [Latex Makefile](https://github.com/shiblon/latex-makefile).
* [entr](http://eradman.com/entrproject/) for automation.
